# react-docs-browser
This repository is for completely overhauling the old docs-browser from vanilla JS to React, and implementing it with github actions CI/CD

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, make sure to run ```npm install``` inside the repository directory to download all dependencies. 

Use ```npm run serve-react-dev``` to run the development server with live reloads available. 

Use ```npm test``` to run the jest testing suite. Make sure to add and develop tests as we go! Each feature should get a file for its own testing suite.
